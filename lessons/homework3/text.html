OPENTABLE BLOG

CADILLAC MAGAZINE

Talk about fusion cuisine: Coffeemania, Moscow’s wildly popular restaurant group, uses Japanese and Italian methods and standards, showcases a uniquely Spanish way of wood-fired cooking, adds a lengthy array of Paris-worthy patisserie sweets and a barista-focused coffee culture, and hangs all this on a framework of Russian heritage. It’s a menu that is easier to enjoy than to describe, because the one thing all the dishes at the first Coffeemania outpost in the U.S. have in common is that they are delicious.
